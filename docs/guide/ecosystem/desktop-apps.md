# Desktop Apps

With Vue you're not limited to developing web and [native mobile](./mobile-apps.md) applications only: you can build a desktop app as well. Why using Vue for it instead of developing it on native languages? There are some important reasons:

- cross-platform: all applications developed with JavaScript can be packaged for Windows/MacOS/Linux;
- easy to build: with some frameworks you simply develop a web application and then 'convert' it to desktop one with a packager;
- community: if you maintain an open-source desktop project, you will more likely to find contributors for your it.

Although there are some downsides common for all JavaScript-powered desktop applications. Usually they have big package size (more than 100 MB) and heavy RAM usage.

We have two main options to build a desktop application with Vue: it's HTML+CSS-based solutions
or native GUI. First one is represented with Electron and NW.js, second option is Vuido.

## Electron

[Electron](https://electronjs.org/) is an open source library developed by GitHub for building cross-platform desktop applications with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Electron accomplishes this by combining Chromium and Node.js into a single runtime and apps can be packaged for Mac, Windows, and Linux

Electron is by far the most popular library for writing JavaScript desktop applications today: the most well-known of them are [Slack](https://slack.com/) and [Discord](https://discordapp.com/) messengers as well as [Atom](https://atom.io/) code editor and [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) IDE.
