# Desktop Apps

With Vue you're not limited to developing web and [native mobile](./mobile-apps.md) applications only: you can build a desktop app as well. Why using Vue for it instead of developing it on native languages? There are some important reasons:

- cross-platform: all applications developed with JavaScript can be packaged for Windows/MacOS/Linux;
- easy to build: with some frameworks you simply develop a web application and then 'convert' it to desktop one with a packager;
- community: if you maintain an open-source desktop project, you will more likely to find contributors for your it.

Although there are some downsides common for all JavaScript-powered desktop applications. Usually they have big package size (more than 100 MB) and heavy RAM usage.

We have two main options to build a desktop application with Vue: it's HTML+CSS-based solutions
or native GUI. First one is represent with Electron and NW.js, second option is Vuido.
